A reentrant function,
if interrupted,
which is not perturbed.
int global_int;int is_not_reentrant(int x) { int x = x; return global_int + x; },
which may change during execution.
int global_int;int is_reentrant(int x) { int saved = global_int; return saved + x; },
mitigates external dependency,
it is reentrant, though not thread safe.
